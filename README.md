This is a MIDI ribbon controller which emulates the behavior of the ribbon on the CS80. My need to create this came from a bunch of shows I did where the band wanted to cover some UK songs, so I bought a Deckard's Dream and then built this.
Double tapping the ribbon will put you into chord mode, and this was my use case: "Presto vivace and reprise". At that point touching the ribbon plays a D major chord in the 2nd inversion when can then be swept down an octave to end "By the light of day".
Below is the schematic for the build, the master branch has the code for the midi only version. I prefer USB as it's less cables, and my patch bay accepts it. 
Good luck, and if you think you can improve my code, which shouldn't be difficult as this was my first arduino project, feel free to submit a pull request.
